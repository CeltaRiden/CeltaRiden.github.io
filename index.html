			<h1>Celta Riden Stuff</h1>
	
			<p>A daughter and one of 6 children born into an eccentric family. I have been encompassed with art music and a diversity of unique individuals most of my life. With limited tv growing up, drawing, painting and creating is something I picked up at an early age, this has helped my creativity and imagination grow with me over the years. It is no surprise that I found a career path in the world of design. </p>
				
			<p>With a taste for adventure, I enjoy new experiences, meeting people and traveling. Alright, so do most people but this is exactly why I enjoy design. It allows me to experience all of those things while also making a living and establishing myself doing what I’ve always enjoyed doing, using my creativity.</p>
				
			<p>Freelancing in Ottawa gives me the chance to meet so many people and build solid business relationships with new clients. The work is never the same, designing for different people brings on new challenges and experiences. I have worked for clients in Ottawa and as far out as Vancouver so the traveling opportunity is definitly there. I’m constantly learning about the trade, people and myself as I grow as a designer.
